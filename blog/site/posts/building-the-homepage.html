      <h1>Building the Homepage</h1>
      <article>
        <p class="date">April 23, 2025</p>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            With my server running and reasonably secure, it was time to set up a proper homepage! I
            already had Grafana exposed at <code>grafana.jamesmassucco.com</code> but I didn't have
            a proper root site at <code>jamesmassucco.com</code>. Again, I relied on ChatGPT to get
            started. I told it I wanted a sleak and simple website for showcasing my coding, and it
            rendered a terminal-style website, and then generated some CSS and HTML to make it real!
            It honestly did a phenomal job, and all I really had to do was edit the content it had
            populated to align with what I wanted to say.
          </p>
          <p>
            To serve it up, I added a new <code>docker-compose.yml</code> under the new top-level
            director <code>homepage/</code> to create an <code>nginx</code> container with a my
            <code>homepage/site/</code> directory mapped into the
            <code>/usr/share/nginx/html</code> directory of the container. After that, all I need to
            do was add my desired top-level directory to my <code>cloudflare-ddns</code> setup and
            it was automatically registered to Cloudflare, and boom - I was able to access my
            website!
          </p>
          <p>
            Once I had a homepage, I wanted to add a bit more content, so I (agin with help from
            ChatGPT) cooked up a Metrics page! I initially wanted to embed Grafana directly in the
            page to show metrics, but this raised some security red flags due to the use of IFrames,
            and so I opted instead to generate some fake metrics, both static ones and a bit of
            JavaScript to make some dynamic plots.
          </p>
          <h2 id="repo-quality-of-life">Repo Quality of Life</h2>
          <p>
            Since the website came together more quickly than I'd expected, I decided to spent a bit
            of time on repo quality of life items. First, I setup a <code>.vscode/</code> directory
            with <code>settings.json</code> and <code>extensions.json</code> files so that default
            settings get automatically applied in any VSCode session accessing the repo, and so that
            the required extensions are automatically suggested.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, I added linters: Prettier (HTML/CSS/Markdown), Stylelint (CSS), and Ruff (Python).
            I made sure to update the VSCode extensions to include them all, and set up
            configuration files for them in the root of the repo using some basic settings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, I setup a <code>bootstrap.sh</code> script to provision a fresh install of the
            repo with the required dependencies. There's still some work to be done there, because
            it does a lot of unnecessary work and has some error messages, but it's enough for now.
            This will be helpful when I start to expand my cluster to multiple pieces of hardware
            and want to provision the repo on each of them during initial configuration.
