          <p>
            This is the first of (hopefully) many posts I'll make to document the process of
            building my home server! I started this project because I want to be able to work on fun
            software infrastructure things without it always having to be for work. I've
            historically been very much a workaholic, and though I'm an Electrical Engineer by
            schooling, I am lately working on more and more software and less and less hardware. My
            girlfriend recently quoted a coworker as saying "hobbies... I've always meant to get
            some of those" and it was a bit of a wake up call for me. So here I am, getting a hobby!
          </p>
          <p>
            My primary goal with this project, as inspired by
            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/wiki/introduction/">r/homelab</a>, is to
            learn! I'm also interested in reinforcing my skills in software, in case I pursue an
            even more software-focused career path in the future.
          </p>
          <p>I'm starting this project with a few learning goals:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Basic network and security, so I don't get my home network hacked</li>
            <li>Domains and DNS, so I can host a website from my home server</li>
            <li>Docker, because it seems useful</li>
            <li>
              Kubernetes, so I can build a cheap cluster of hardware (and also because it seems like
              a "hot" thing to know for SW infra jobs)
            </li>
            <li>
              HTML/CSS (and more advanced web stuff) so that I can build some cool webapps (purpose
              TBD other than that I like making stuff)
            </li>
            <li>LLMs, so I can make my webapps "powered by AI" lol</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            I'm receiving my (first) server today, and will post details of my learning and setup as
            soon as I get started!
