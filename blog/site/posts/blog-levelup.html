            <p>
              The first rev of my blog has been doing fine, but I really wanted something a little
              bit richer and easier to navigate. I wanted a page for each post as well as a homepage
              that shows all the posts in order. I also wanted to add an RSS feed (as requested by
              my coworker Michael).
            </p>
            <p>
              I started out by moving my blog out from under my <code>homepage</code> project into
              its own dedicated site. I also gave it a new URL, <code>blog.jamesmassucco.com</code>.
              While adding this into my <code>cloudflare-ddns</code> container configuration (which,
              by the way, makes it insanely easy to establish new subdomains directly in code), I
              realized that it was clunky to be defining my list of domains in a gitignore'd
              <code>.env</code> file and so I moved it into the <code>docker-compose.yml</code>. Now
              it'll be even easier to add (and keep track of) new subdomains, since I seem to be
              adding at least 1~2 of them every week!
            </p>
            <p>
              The first thing I did was restructure my markdown files to have a proper metadata
              section. I used the <code>frontmatter</code> specification, which allows encoding
              metadata by inserting a block like this at the top of a file:
            </p>
            <div class="codehilite">
              <pre><span></span><code>---
title: &#39;Leveling Up My Blog&#39;
date: &#39;2025-05-11&#39;
tags: [blog]
summary: &#39;Turning my blog into a dedicated app with a page for each post&#39;
<span class="gu">slug: blog-levelup</span>
<span class="gu">---</span>
</code></pre>
            </div>

            <p>
              The title and date were already existing. I added <code>tags</code> for potential
              future use, the <code>summary</code> for displaying on the main page, and
              <code>slug</code> will be the name of each posts' HTML page (e.g.
              <code>blog.jamesmassucco.com/posts/blog-levelup.html</code>). Parsing the data out is
              pretty simple - just <code>import frontmatter</code> in python and then
              <code>frontmatter.load(&lt;md_path&gt;)</code> and you get a result with
              <code>content</code> and <code>metadata</code>. The <code>content</code> was the same
              as the markdown I was used to working with (doesn't include the metadata), while the
              <code>metadata</code> made available a dictionary of key-value pairs with the metadata
              I had encoded. To make it easier to access the metadata, I created a
              <code>pydantic</code> class so that instead of <code>metadata['title']</code>, I could
              do <code>metadata.title</code>. I hate typing quotation marks lol. I also added a
              class to represent each blog post, handle parsing it with <code>frontmatter</code>,
              and do a few more convenience functions.
            </p>
            <p>Once I had all the posts parsed, I needed to generate 3 sets of outputs:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>An <code>index.html</code> to serve as the new blog homepage</li>
              <li>A <code>&lt;post-slug&gt;.html</code> for each blog post</li>
              <li>An <code>rss.xml</code> to provide RSS feed functionality</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              For each of these, I created a <code>jinja2</code> template. Jinja is a powerful
              python templating engine. It allows you to write a document (e.g. html) that includes
              special tags like <code>{{ post.metadata.date }}</code>, and then feed in a
              <code>post</code> object to the <code>render</code> operation and it will replace the
              <code>{{ }}</code> blocks with rendered data from your object. It also has a very
              useful for-loop function, and a few other functions that proved useful for this
              exercise. I used ChatGPT to get basic versions of each of the 3 templates, and then
              spent some time tweaking them to fit the style of the rest of the site. After an hour
              or so, the site was looking pretty rad.
            </p>
            <p>
              To finish it off, I killed off the old static blog and replaced it with a link to this
              new <code>blog.jamesmassucco.com</code> I also made each blog post page include a
              <code>Blog Home</code> button in the top-left, as opposed to the typical
              <code>Home</code> button found on the other pages. That way, if someone is viewing a
              blog post, they can click back to the main page of the blog. The main page of the blog
              then includes a <code>Home</code> link to go back to the main site home, but I figured
              if someone is reading a blog post, it's more likely that they want to go back to the
              blog index than the top-level site home. Maybe sometime soon I'll add some more
              navigational functionality - but this should work fine for now.
