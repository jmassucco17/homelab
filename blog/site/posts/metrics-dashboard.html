      <h1>Building a Metrics Dashboard</h1>
      <article>
        <p class="date">May 10, 2025</p>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            When I first created my homepage a few weeks ago, I wanted to display some server
            metrics on the site, but it was a bit too big of a project for me to bite off at that
            point. But this week, I was ready to take a proper swing at it. I had heard of
            <code>FastAPI</code> as a simple and powerful Python module for HTTP APIs, so I decided
            to use that to make Prometheus query results available to my webpage. I also found out
            about <code>htmx</code> in my reading, which is a javascript library that extends html
            and makes it possible to have individual elements of a page complete recurring GET
            requests (i.e. "auto-refresh" of queries). And I also selected Chart.JS for rendering
            chart-view metrics, as opposed to just simple single-value metrics.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the first cut of the page, I picked a few basic metrics for CPU and Memory Usage,
            Disk Space, and Network Rx. I copied the queries for these from my Grafana dashboard.
            The first piece of the puzzle was to make the Prometheus queries available to HTML (or
            htmx, in my case). That's where FastAPI came in. I built a simple app with endpoints
            like <code>/queries/cpu</code> and <code>/queries/memory</code>. The definition for each
            endpoint was to query data from prometheus, and then return it. Originally, I thought
            that I could just return the raw data and then render it in higher-level html, but it
            turns out that for htmx queries, it expects the response to already be an HTML document,
            not just a raw value, so I added a simple template to help render the value of each
            endpoint into a "widget". Once I had the widgets defined, I also needed a top-level html
            page (at <code>/</code>) that displayed the widgets and automatically refreshed their
            values. I had ChatGPT cook up a simple template, but realized that I wanted to pull in
            the same CSS I was using for my homepage site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since I was building the dashboard as it's own top-level directory and application, it
            was a little complicated to have shared CSS with my main homepage. I originally hoped to
            just symlink the files, but that doesn't work with docker very well. So I moved the
            common files (<code>main.css</code> as well as the icon files for the site) into a
            top-level <code>shared-assets</code> directory and then built a simple
            <code>sync_assets.sh</code> script that copies those files from the shared directory
            into all child directories (right now, just <code>homepage/</code> and
            <code>dashboard/</code>). I figure this will be useful in the future when I build more
            top-level apps that want to use the same style as my other pages.
          </p>
          <p>
            With this, I had the first iteration of my dashboard built! It was pretty cool, but
            kinda boring with just singular numbers for each metric. So I had ChatGPT help me build
            some charts based on the same metrics using Chart.JS. The rendering is a bit clunky and
            I definitely need to do some more reading because I'm a total JS noob, but I at least
            got them in and working which was cool! After some more tweaking of the look and feel of
            the site, I was happy enough with it that I connected it into my main homepage,
            replacing (and deleting) the old "fake metrics" page I had put together as a placeholder
            lol.
          </p>
          <p>
            While I was in there, I also added links to all of my services that host their own
            dashboards: in addition to Grafana (which was already there), I added in
            <code>traefik</code>, <code>prometheus</code>, and <code>whoami</code>. I'm really happy
            with how the page is coming together, and I think I'm almost ready to share it more
            publicly (LinkedIn, resum√©, etc).
