As I started to set up my home server, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was going to do something stupid and leave my home network open to hacking. So I did a deep dive (with ChatGPT) about what to look into to improve my security. It had some great advice:

1. Configure firewall to only allow traffic from Cloudflare
2. Use [ShieldsUP!](https://www.grc.com/x/ne.dll?bh0bkyd2) to scan my network for any vulnerabilities
3. Add OAuth for Grafana and other admin-only services, or require a VPN to access them
4. Get a router with VLAN capabilities to completely separate my server from the rest of my home network
5. Add rate-limiting configuration to `traefik` to prevent excessive access
6. Add Captcha or 2FA with something like Authelia or Authentik
7. Add logging and alerts about attacks with `ufw` logs or `fail2ban`
8. Regularly update everything

I accomplished Step 1 pretty easily by extending the (arguably unnecessary) script I wrote early to update `traefik` allowed IPs from Cloudflare to also update my `ufw` rules to default deny all traffic on ports 80 and 443 and only allow it from Cloudlfare IPs. For convenience, I also added a comment (`# Cloudflare`) to all of these automated rules so that my script could easily purge them and re-enter them without affecting other firewall rules I configured myself. Parts 2 and 5 were also a breeze. And I purchased a lightly used [ASUS RT-AX86U](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BQ417K47) router so that I could work on Step 4.

I decided to defer Steps 3/6/7/8 to a future development session.

But the suggestion of a VPN did get me thinking that I wanted to be able to develop on my server even when away from home. ChatGPT suggested [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) which was astoundingly easy to setup. Within a few minutes, I was able to access my server with my laptop on a hotspot. And because it's a VPN, the access is very secure; I have to login to the same Tailscale account on both machines (which is secured with Google OAuth) and I only have to allow access on `ufw` for the Tailscale IP range (`100.64.0.0/10`).
